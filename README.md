# Rock Paper Scissors #

This is just a simple game to help me learn Fortran 90/95.

### What features of Fortran were used? ###

* Modules
* Random Numbers
* Input/Output
* Subroutines
* While Loops
* Decision Making
* Subroutine parameters and return values.
* Select-Case

### How do I build? ###

* All you need is a Fortran Compiler that supports the 1990 or 1995 standards.
    * I used the Fortran frontend for GCC (`gfortran`) to make this, but it might work on Intel or IBM compilers.
        * I don't know if the `rand()` function is standardized or if it's a GNU extension.

### Why Fortran??! ###

* Why not? :smile:
* I like learning new things, and not too many people know Fortran.
